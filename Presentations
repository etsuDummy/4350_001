Each Student must do 2 presentations, 10-15 minutes in length, 
with an intro-body-conclusion format (Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them)
You can only choose at most one topic from a category (e.g. you can't do Kanban AND Crystal).
Put your Name (first and last) next to the topic you choose. 
No more than 2 students can choose the same topic. 
You can not remove someone's name from a topic. If you want it and it already has 2 students associated with it, then
you can team up with someone and co-present: if you do team up, the presentation must be 15-20 minutes in length and each person must do ~50% of the presentation
